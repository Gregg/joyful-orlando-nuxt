Together with <strong><a href="http://pla.yoga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex of PLA.Yoga</a></strong> and <strong>Kenissa Cox of Ambient Productions</strong>, we're transforming the <strong>CityArts Courtyard</strong> into an immersive open-air sanctuary for movement, music, and connection.
                                                                </p>

                                                                        We'll begin with a grounded yoga flow that melts into an ecstatic dance journey, all guided through <strong>wireless headphones</strong> so every breath, beat, and moment feels intimately your own. As the sun rises over downtown, guests can enjoy <strong>CityArts Café's signature coffee blend</strong>, served complimentary throughout the morning to keep you warm and connected.
                                                                </p>
